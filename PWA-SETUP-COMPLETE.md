## 🎨 Customizing Your PWA

### Update App Name:
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Custom App Name",
  "short_name": "YourApp"
}
```

### Change Theme Colors:
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "background_color": "#your-color",
  "theme_color": "#your-color"
}
```

Also update in `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```typescript
themeColor: '#your-color'
```

### Better App Icons:
- Replace `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png`
- Use https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator for professional icons
- Recommended: Transparent background or matches your app theme
